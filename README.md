## My SoC Labs Journey üöÄ
![Journey](https://img.shields.io/badge/From_Design_to_Silicon-with_Industry--Grade_Tools-magenta?style=for-the-badge&logo=chip&logoColor=white)

This repo is not just code and screenshots ‚Äî it‚Äôs a record of my journey through the **VSD SoC Labs Program**.  
I‚Äôm starting from the very beginning, with no shortcuts. Every week, I‚Äôll document what I learn, what I build, and even the mistakes I make along the way. 
I‚Äôm documenting this so future learners (and my future self) can see the growth from day 0 to the final tapeout.

# üöÄ Week 0 ‚Äì Setup & Tools

| Week | Task Description | Status |
|------|------------------|--------|
| 0 | üõ†Ô∏è Tools Installation <br> Installed **Yosys**, **Icarus Verilog**, **GTKWave**, **Ngspice**, **Magic**, **OpenLANE** | ‚úîÔ∏è Completed |

## Skill-Oriented

- ‚úÖDeveloped confidence in using **Linux terminal** for tool installation & verification.
- ‚úÖLearned how to troubleshoot and fix installation issues.
- ‚úÖPrepared a stable environment for design, verification, and layout tasks in future weeks.


## üôè Acknowledgment

I would like to sincerely thank **IIT Gandhinagar**, the **VSD (VLSI System Design) team**, and **Kunal Ghosh sir** for creating and leading the SoC Labs Program.  
This initiative has providing a unique opportunity to learn **end-to-end SoC design** using industry-grade tools in a fully open-source environment.  

Gratitude also goes to the **open-source EDA community** for developing and maintaining powerful tools such as **Yosys, Icarus Verilog, GTKWave, Ngspice, Magic, and OpenLANE**. 
Their contributions make it possible for students and enthusiasts worldwide to explore chip design without restrictions.  

A special thanks to the VSD team for making this program **free and accessible**, breaking barriers to VLSI education and empowering learners like me to take the first steps from **RTL ‚Üí GDSII design flow**.  

This journey is possible only because of the combined efforts of educators, researchers, and the global open-source community.
