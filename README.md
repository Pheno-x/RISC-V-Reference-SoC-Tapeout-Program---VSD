## My SoC Labs Journey 🚀

> 🚀 **From Design to Silicon with Industry-Grade Tools** 🔧

This repo is not just code and screenshots — it’s a record of my journey through the **VSD SoC Labs Program**.  
I’m starting from the very beginning, with no shortcuts. Every week, I’ll document what I learn, what I build, and even the mistakes I make along the way. 
I’m documenting this so future learners (and my future self) can see the growth from day 0 to the final tapeout.

## 🙏 Acknowledgment

I would like to sincerely thank **IIT Gandhinagar**, the **VSD (VLSI System Design) team**, and **Kunal Ghosh sir** for creating and leading the SoC Labs Program.  
This initiative has providing a unique opportunity to learn **end-to-end SoC design** using industry-grade tools in a fully open-source environment.  

Gratitude also goes to the **open-source EDA community** for developing and maintaining powerful tools such as **Yosys, Icarus Verilog, GTKWave, Ngspice, Magic, and OpenLANE**. 
Their contributions make it possible for students and enthusiasts worldwide to explore chip design without restrictions.  

A special thanks to the VSD team for making this program **free and accessible**, breaking barriers to VLSI education and empowering learners like me to take the first steps from **RTL → GDSII design flow**.  

This journey is possible only because of the combined efforts of educators, researchers, and the global open-source community.
