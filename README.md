## My SoC Labs Journey ðŸš€
***From Design to Silicon with Industry-Grade Tools***


This repo is not just code and screenshots â€” itâ€™s a record of my journey through the **VSD SoC Labs Program**.  
Iâ€™m starting from the very beginning, with no shortcuts. Every week, Iâ€™ll document what I learn, what I build, and even the mistakes I make along the way. 

Iâ€™m documenting this so future learners (and my future self) can see the growth from day 0 to the final tapeout.
